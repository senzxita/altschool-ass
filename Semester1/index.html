                <section>
                    <p>A student of <b>AltSchool Africa</b>, enrolled with the July batch in 2023, but I had to defer my
                        admission (in 1st semester) due to circumstances that limited me from being able to pay full
                        attention to the AltSchool Programme. I rejoined the AltSchool again in May 2024, this time with
                        more dedication, resilience and determination to see the programme through to the end and
                        graduate
                        as a <i><b>Backend Engineer</b></i>. I studied Computer Science and has been in the DevOps
                        engineering field for sometime now, but haven't had any production experience. I currently work
                        as a
                        <i><b>Project Manager</b></i> managing DevOps projects majorly and other Dev, QA, Data
                        Engineering
                        projects. My line of requires the knowledge of least one programming language. This is part of
                        my
                        aim this session, to equip myself with this skill in other to be successful in my career.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am still very much interested in DevOps Engineering, I create Pet projects to continually
                        skilling
                        up in that area. I can't wait to be able to build a Portfolio, I have so many skills to
                        showcase. I
                        have also written Technical articles in the past. In future, I still want to be a DevOps
                        Engineer
                        who understands how APIs are built and also understand how applications are being developed
                        generally. Also to know how to program in Python and Golang. It is a journey and a long ride but
                        I
                        am determined to get to my destination.</p>

                <h2><b>Why did you join AltSchool Africa?</b></h2>
                <p>I joined AltSchool Africa because I want to be a Software Engineer, be better and skilled at coding.
                    I would love to know how to code with Python and Golang. Be skilled at creating APIs and have the
                    full understanding of how applications are being developed.

                    AltSchool Africa provides a diploma certificate that is recognized in most places, the certificate
                    coupled with my aquired skillset, I would be able to easily get a job as a Software Engineer.
                    Besides, Mr Setemi is a wonderful tutor. Thanks to AltSchool Africa for this great opportunity.</p>
